# Lab4-KarimHabbal_HamzaAtout

A project combining Tkinter and PyQt documented implementations

## How to Run the Interfaces

### PyQt Interface
1. Make sure you have Python 3 and PyQt5 installed:
	```sh
	pip install PyQt5
	```
2. Run the PyQt interface:
	```sh
	python PyQt5_Integration-1.py
	```
	or
	```sh
	python PyQt5.py
	```
3. The PyQt window will open. Use the forms to add/edit students, instructors, and courses. Use the tabs to view and manage records. You can save/load data and export CSVs from the toolbar.

### Tkinter Interface
1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed (Tkinter is included by default).
2. Run the Tkinter interface:
	```sh
	python Tkinter.py
	```
3. The Tkinter window will open. Use the provided controls to manage school data similarly to the PyQt interface.

## General Usage
- Both interfaces allow you to add, edit, and delete students, instructors, and courses.
- You can register students to courses and assign instructors.
- Use the search bar to filter records.
- Save/load your data as JSON, and export to CSV for external use.
